# component-react

A plugin to transpile [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) JS files ('.js or .jsx') for the component builder.

## Install

`$ npm install component-react`

## Usage
  
Add your `.jsx` files to the `react` array in your `component.json`:

```javascript
{
  "scripts": [
    "index.js"
  ],
	"react": [
		"button.jsx"
	]
}
```

Then either use the ```component``` command:

```bash
$ component build --use component-react
```

Or use the plugin during your custom build process:

```javascript
var Builder = require('component-builder')
  , react = require('component-react')
  , fs = require('fs')
  ;

var builder = new Builder(__dirname);

builder.use(react);

builder.build(function (err, res) {
	if (err) {
		throw err
	}

	fs.writeFileSync('build/build.js', res.require + res.js);

	if (res.css) {
		fs.writeFileSync('build/build.css', res.css);
	}
});
```
